        As a private, non-sectarian academic institution, Cebu Institute of Technology – University aims to:
        <br>
        The Core Values are identified traits that build the heart and character of a Technologian. These attributes are founded on the Filipino cultural values
        <br>

      <p><strong>>Culture of excellence</strong></p>
      A commitment to go beyond the ordinary; steadfast in delivering data-driven, value-optimized and client-centric service
      Inspired by the Filipino hospitality, an environment that empowers individuals to be their best makes you feel like you belong. When employees are happy and take pride in their jobs, they naturally want to make their clients and customers
      happy. Culture of Excellence is demonstrated in practicing common courtesies and professionalism in dealing with colleagues and other stakeholders.
      <br>

      <p><strong>>Integrity</strong></p>
      Uncompromising adherence to moral and ethical principles
      Trust, honor, and honesty are key elements to the concept of integrity. These traits foster a positive workplace culture. A person with integrity takes responsibility for one’s actions. The concept of hiya or sense of proriety and palabra de
      honor or word of honor give a Filipino a sense of social decency and politeness. Integrity is exemplified in observing timelines, punctuality in reporting to work, transparency of processes, validity of examinations, among others.
      <br>

      <p><strong>>Teamwork</strong></p>
      Promoting a culture of collaboration and empowerment/ Commitment to purposeful collaboration to advocate for innovative solutions
      Bayanihan is a core essence of the Filipino culture. This refers to a group or a community coming together and helping one another to achieve a common, greater goal. It is also called the ‘community spirit’. The value of helping one another,
      without expecting anything else in return
      <br>

      <p><strong>>Universality</strong></p>
      Regard for the welfare of people and nature/ Respect for all and stewardship of God’s creation / Promotion of common good of, by and for all
      Pakikipagkapwa-tao means treating each other with utmost respect. It is the foundation for unity as well as of the sense of social justice. Those engaging in pakikipagkapwa-tao are expected not only to understand others but also develop a
      sincere interest in their well-being.
